    <p>A Classic Indian vegetable biryani is a perfect dish for any occasion.
         Long grain basmati rice and assorted vegetables in a spicy masala are 
         cooked in alternate layers under dum to give you a final dish that is 
         a treat to your all of your senses. Whole spices, fragrant rice, 
         nutritious veggies and the aromatic saffron blend together perfectly
          in this vegetable biryani recipe and that is the magic of a good dum 
          biryani. Plus this one is a microwave version of it, so it really is a
           quick biryani unlike a traditional clay pot one that takes hours for 
           the dum to build and the biryani itself to cook. This is what I love 
           to eat when a biryani craving hits! Tried, tested and loved by several
            of our viewers this one is well worth a try.
