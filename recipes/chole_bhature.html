    <h1>Chole Bhature</h1>

    <img src="../img/chole-bhature-recipe.jpg" alt="Well Cooked-Chole Bhature" >

    <p>Chole bhature, also known as 'channa bhatura' is a North-Indian must-have.
         A combination of two dishes—chole, which is a spicy chickpea curry, and 
         bhature, a type of fried bread made with maida—it makes for a meal that's 
         just right for Sunday afternoons, and should ideally be followed by a 
         post-lunch snooze.
